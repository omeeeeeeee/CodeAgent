=== CSV REPORT EXPLANATION ===

METRICS DESCRIPTION:
• Events (ex. manual),Total UI events excluding manual/system actions
• Keystrokes non-Shift,Number of keystroke events (excluding Shift keys)
• Clicks total,Total number of mouse click events
• Clicks pre-Enter,Mouse clicks before first Enter key press
• Clicks post-Enter,Mouse clicks after first Enter key press
• First Enter index,Position of first Enter key in event sequence
• Active duration,Time from first to last event (seconds)

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
• Positive Delta (A-B),A performed more actions/took longer than B
• Negative Delta (A-B),A performed fewer actions/was faster than B
• Lower event counts,Generally indicate higher efficiency
• Shorter duration,Usually indicates better performance
• Text match = YES,Both recordings produced same text input
• Text match = NO,Different text inputs detected (accuracy issue)

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS:
• Efficiency,Fewer events + shorter duration = more efficient
• Accuracy,Text match + similar click patterns = higher accuracy
• Consistency,Similar event distribution = more predictable behavior
